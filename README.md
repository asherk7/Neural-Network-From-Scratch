# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch  

## Overview  
This repository contains an implementation of a convolutional neural network built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of neural networks, including:  
- Forward propagation  
- Backward propagation  
- Activation functions  
- Loss functions  
- Optimization techniques  

The network will be trained and evaluated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks.

## Features  
- Manual implementation of key neural network components:
  - Multiple layers (e.g. Dense, Convolutional, etc.)
  - Non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Softmax)
  - Loss functions (e.g., Cross-Entropy)
  - Gradient descent and backpropagation
- Training and evaluation pipeline for the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Visualization of learning metrics (e.g., loss and accuracy)

## Objectives  
1. Understand the mathematical foundations of neural networks.  
2. Implement a neural network without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
3. Build intuition on how different components work together.
